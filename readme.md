# First practice module Node.js KeepCoding

## Goal
Build an API for advertisment buy/sell and create system filter in mongo DB. It is not the object of this practice to create a front with React.JS, but to practice, I have decided to include it.

<br>

# INSTRUCTIONS:

## 1. Start the API:
Go to the API root at keepads/ and install packages from package.json:

```shell
cd keepads
npm install
```

### install DB
To initialize the database once and have ads the first time

```shell
cd keepads
npm run install:db
```

### start API
To start API system

```shell
cd keepads
npm run dev
```

In your browser go to http://localhost:9000/apiv1/ads and see json with advertisements

<br>

## 2. Create React app
Go to the client root at client/ and install packages from package.json:

```shell
cd client
npm install
```

### start client
To start client frontend

```shell
cd client
npm start
```

In your browser go to http://localhost:3000/ and see cards with advertisements and very very simple filter system

<br>

GET /apiv1/ads?type=**type**

    ]
}

<br>

## ESLINT:

I have included EsLint only for the API folder. If you want to eslint check the **.eslintrc.json** rules, you can do the following code: 

```shell
cd keepads
npm run lint
```

This will show in the *shell* the places in the code that should be fixed depending on the **.eslintrc.json** rules. **To test it I have left the API index.js file unresolved**

<br>

For init a new **.eslintrc.json** in the project:

```shell
cd keepads
npm run init:lint
```

To automatically fix files according to **.eslintrc.json** rules:

```shell
cd keepads
npm run fix:lint
```
